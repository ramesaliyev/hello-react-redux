# Hello React/Redux

This repo contains react/redux practices. First several folders are created by following two great free egghead courses respectively.
- [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)
- [Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux)

After first several folders i enhanced todo-app by using additional redux environment libraries and more.

## Main Folders

### 01 Primitive
Contains basics of redux and primitive examples. These examples are from "**Getting Started with Redux**". Every example has url (at the beginning of the file) to related jsbin.com example. If these urls are not working anymore, please create single HTML page and include followed libraries for make examples work again:

- redux/3.6.0
- react/15.4.2
- react-dom/15.4.2
- react-redux/5.0.3
- expect/latest (for tests)
- deepfreeze/latest (for tests)

Use exact versions if your example if not working. Maybe somethings were changed. 

### 02 With React
Continuation of the Primitive folder with adding react. These examples also from "**Getting Started with Redux**". And they also have jsbin.com url. If urls not working consult above.

### 03 Restructured
This folder contains first form of "**Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux**" course content. You can also navigate to [ramesaliyev/todos](https://github.com/ramesaliyev/todos) repo (*forked from gaearon/todos*) to see step-by-step evolution (follow evolution via well-named branches) of this structured version of todo app.

### 04 Enhanced
Continuation of the Restructured folder by watching "**Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux**" course. This folder contains last shape of example. Consult above if you want to check step-by-step evolution.
